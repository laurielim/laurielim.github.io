Hi, I’m a responsible developer in Helsinki. Responsible as in I make [responsive and accessible](https://responsibleweb.app/) websites. Thank you for checking out my portfolio.

I’m currently working as a Software Developer at [Druid Oy](https://druid.fi/). In my free time, I like to read webtoons, listen to DnD podcasts and rock climbing.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/laurielimsam), inspect my code on [Github](https://github.com/laurielim) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurielim/).
