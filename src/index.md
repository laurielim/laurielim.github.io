Hi, I’m a Software Developer and [Apprentice Initiator](/posts/what-is-an-apprentice-initiator/) based in Helsinki. I build accessible websites and help new developers grow.

I’m currently working at [Druid Oy](https://druid.fi/). Outside of work, I like to read webtoons, listen to DnD podcasts and rock climbing.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurielim/), inspect my code on [Github](https://github.com/laurielim) and connect with me via [email](mailto:laurie.limsam@gmail.com).
