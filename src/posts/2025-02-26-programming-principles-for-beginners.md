title: Programming concepts for aspiring software developers
---
When you start to learn programming, there's a lot to take in. Usually, the first step is learning a programming language, such as JavaScript. Then, you should start building projects with your newfound knowledge and [avoid tutorial hell](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-learn-from-coding-tutorials-and-avoid-tutorial-hell/). At this stage, programming might feel like a solo activity, but if your goal is [becoming a software developer](/posts/becoming-a-software-developer), understanding these concepts is crucial to work effectively as part of a team.

While there’s a lot of emphasis on practice and not so much on theory (rightfully so), I believe there are certain programming concepts that are important to know from the beginning. Many of these concepts, like clean code and coding conventions, are essential for working effectively as part of a team. They help you write code that’s easier for others to read, understand, and maintain—skills that are invaluable in a professional setting.

Even as a solo learner, developing these habits early will make your code easier to manage and prepare you for the collaborative nature of software development. I won’t go into details for each concept, as there are plenty of great resources available online. Instead, this list serves as a starting point—a baseline of things to understand and explore as you learn and develop software.

<h3 id="clean-code">Clean code</h3>

Good code is often synonymous with [clean code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/). Clean code means code that is easy to read and understand, both for yourself and others. When you join a software project or company, you’ll often be dealing with code that many other people have worked on over a long period of time. If the code is messy, it’s harder to figure out what’s going on, fix bugs, or add new features. Clean code is important because it saves time, reduces confusion, and makes sure everyone on the team can work together smoothly.

<h3 id="programming-principles">Programming principles</h3>

Programming principles are guidelines and best practices that help developers write code that is easier to understand and maintain. While there are many principles, here are three that are notably helpful when you're just starting out:

  1.  [KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle): This means you should aim to write simple code that gets the job done without unnecessary complexity. Over-complicating things might feel clever at first, but it usually creates headaches down the road, like when you revisit the code months later.

  1. [DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself): This principle is about reducing unnecessary repetition in your code. If you find yourself copying the same code in multiple places, it's usually a sign that you should [refactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) it—meaning, find a way to reuse the code instead of repeating it. But not all duplication is bad! A good rule of thumb is: duplicating something once is okay, but if you're about to repeat the same code a third time, it’s probably time to refactor, such as by using a function or other reusable structure.

  1.  [SoC (Separation of Concerns)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns): This means keeping different parts of your code focused on one job or responsibility. For example, the code that handles user input should be separate from the code that processes data. This makes your code more organized and easier to change without breaking other parts.

<h3 id="coding-conventions">Coding conventions</h3>

In any programming language, there are usually [coding conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions) that help everyone write code in the same style. These conventions cover how to name variables, organize files, and structure code. While these details may seem small, they ensure consistency and help teams work smoothly together. Many companies also add their own coding standards on top of language or framework conventions.

Since there’s no universal standard, always check the coding guidelines for the language, framework, or team you're working with.


<h3 id="modularity">Modularity</h3>

[Modular programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) involves breaking your code into smaller, manageable parts, similar to how a car is made up of components like the engine, wheels, and brakes. Each part has a specific function, making it easier to build, maintain, and repair without affecting other components. Likewise, modular programming divides code into distinct 'modules' that handle specific tasks, implementing Separation of Concerns to keep responsibilities clearly defined.

<h3 id="abstraction">Abstraction</h3>

[Abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)) means simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details. In programming, abstraction helps you to focus on what a piece of code does without worrying about how it does it. I like to use this concept for learning programming. Think of it like driving a car: you don’t need to understand how the engine works to learn to drive. Similarly, when you write code, you use tools like libraries and frameworks without needing to know exactly how they work under the hood. As you gain experience, things will start to click into place.

## Moving forward

As you continue to learn programming, remember that learning is a process filled with both challenges and rewards. Understanding concepts like clean code, programming principles, coding conventions, modularity, and abstraction can provide a solid foundation as you develop your skills.

The key is to be patient and keep moving forward. Focus on writing good code and gradually deepen your understanding of the underlying principles and concepts. Embrace the learning experience, and over time, you’ll find that programming becomes not only easier but also more enjoyable.
