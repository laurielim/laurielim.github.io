title: "What is an 'Apprentice Initiator'?"
---
If you’ve seen my resume, you might have noticed an unusual title alongside Software Developer: Apprentice Initiator. It’s not an official job title, but it reflects something very real I’ve been doing since 2022, and something I’m incredibly proud of.

I work as a [software developer](/posts/becoming-a-software-developer/), but alongside writing code, fixing bugs, and pushing commits, I’ve also been lucky enough to help others get started in tech. Not just casually answering questions, but actively guiding new interns and junior developers as they begin their careers.

## How It Started
In 2022, my manager asked if I could help out at a workshop for students of the full-stack development course at Business College Helsinki (BCH), the same program I had been in just a year earlier. The session focused on setting up a Drupal project, managing configurations, and creating and reviewing pull requests. Because I was familiar with the program and understood where the students might struggle, it felt natural to guide them.

In early 2023, we brought in five interns from that same course. [Having recently been in their shoes](http://localhost:8080/posts/my-internship-experience-at-druid/), I naturally stepped in to support them; I answered questions, reviewed code, and helped them get started. A few months later, my manager recognized the effort with a pay bump, and I began treating it as an official part of my role. Once the interns were hired as junior developers, I held monthly one-on-one check-ins to help them set goals and stay aligned with their growth throughout their probation period.

## Growing the Role
At the end of 2023, I returned to BCH to meet the next group of students. This time, I played a more active role, identifying potential interns and selecting one to join our team. By the time the internship began in January 2024, I had developed a structured onboarding process: introducing them to Drupal through a hands-on learning project that reflected real-world frontend, backend, and site-building tasks. When client projects came in, they contributed there too. We also had monthly check-ins to support both technical growth and confidence-building.

In 2024, Druid sponsored the program again. I served as a technical guide for the students’ capstone projects and led a workshop which was an improved version of the one I had previously co-facilitated. I wrote more about that experience in [Druid’s on­going part­ners­hip with Bu­si­ness Col­le­ge Hel­sin­ki](https://druid.fi/en/blog/druids-ongoing-partnership-with-business-college-helsinki/).

After the student projects' final presentation, I interviewed candidates from the program and selected two interns to join us in 2025. With each round, the process continued to evolve. I refined the learning project, improved documentation, and adapted the onboarding based on feedback and experience. What began as informal guidance had become a structured, repeatable approach to helping new developers get started.

## Why It Matters
When I started, I didn’t have much support, no clear mentor, and no structured guidance. I had to figure out a lot on my own. That experience has shaped how I approach this part of my role. A big part of what drives me is simply being the mentor I wish I had: someone approachable, honest, and invested in others’ growth. It means caring about where someone wants to go, not just what they’re doing today, and creating an environment where it’s safe to ask questions, make mistakes, and learn.

Mentoring has also multiplied my own learning. [Preparing to explain concepts forces me to understand the material more deeply](/posts/programming-principles-for-beginners/) and become a better communicator by breaking down complex ideas into approachable pieces, a skill that translates directly to bridging the gap between business needs and technical solutions in client work. By fostering a culture of knowledge sharing, I help create an environment that benefits everyone, including myself.

I’m still a software developer, which is my official title, but this role as an Apprentice Initiator is something I genuinely enjoy. It’s rewarding to help others grow and see them succeed. Helping others thrive has become a meaningful part of my journey. This role has taught me that true growth happens when we support each other, a lesson I carry into every project and team I’m part of.
