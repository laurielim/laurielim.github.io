### Purpose & Goal
Speed Game was a task from [the JavaScript course I did](https://github.com/laurielim/REACT21K_JAVASCRIPT) at Business College Helsinki. This is the second live webpage I made during the course. My mom still plays the game to pass the time and I think that's my best achievement so far.

### Web Stack
This page is built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. During my React course, I did recreate the basic [Speed Game using React](https://github.com/laurielim/REACT21K_REACT_JS/tree/main/task-04-speed-game). However, I wanted to highlight this one because it contains iterations as I learn more about web development.

### Design
Around the time I was working on this, I was working with the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) for another lesson. Hence I decided to make it Pokemon themed, using the sprites from the API, and the [pokemon color scheme](https://www.schemecolor.com/pokemon-colors.php#:~:text=The%20Pokemon%20Color%20Scheme%20palette,and%20Gold%20Foil%20(%23B3A125).) as my color palette.

### Development
Part of the development was done in class, after which we were tasked to complete it. This included styling the game and adding images and sounds. Once I met the basic task requirements, I added elements I thought would be nice for a game.

- I made 3 difficulty levels, each with a different background music.
- For mobile users, there is a setting menu for choosing the level.
- The "Game Over" music depends on the player's score.
- After reading about UX related to sound effects, I made it possible for users to turn sound on and off.
- Session highscore and sound settings are stored
- Based on user feedback, I included game instructions which popup for first time visitors.

As I mentioned, this webpage contains iterations. And as I continue learning, there might be further iterations.

### Lessons Learnt
This is a simple webpage but I put into practice various fundamental elements of JavaScript. Notably, handling arrays, DOM manipulation and the Event loop. I also learnt to not assume what is "obvious" or not. When I first shared the webpage, I was asked multiple times how to play the game. Just adding instructions greatly improved UX and highlighted for me the importance of user feedback.
