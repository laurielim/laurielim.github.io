### Purpose & Goal
In March 2021, while learning the fundamentals of web development, I came across [A Single Div](https://a.singlediv.com): a CSS drawing project by Lynn Fisher. I was blown away by what this person achieved with CSS only. In the page header was [#divtober](https://a.singlediv.com/divtober2020/) where I found the prompt list for October 2020. I immediately started making my first CSS drawing.

I wanted to see how I was progressing on my journey to learn web development. I was learning new things everyday, either in class or by myself. I knew that I did not have the skills to create amazing drawings but it was a good challenge to hone them.

### Lessons Learnt
This collection is incomplete and it is highly unlikely to be completed. Life happened and in a way, I lost interest. Nonetheless, I learnt a lot from this challenge and I am more comfortable with CSS thanks to it. In turn, it has made me a better developer, equiped with more tools to tackle front end challengers.
