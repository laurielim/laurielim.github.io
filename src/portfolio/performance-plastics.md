### Purpose & Goal
In 2019, I made this company website on Wordpress, using the website builder Elementor. Now that I have experience in web development, I want to rebuild the website with a modern techstack focusing on performance and accessibility.

### Web Stack
The new website is built with [static site generator Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). While most of the content is static, the website also hosts a product catalogue that changes occassionally. To allow for a content editor to update the catalogue, I used [headless CMS Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) to store the catalogue data. The site is hosted on a private server but once I have the MVP, I will change it to Github Pages, using Github Actions to build and deploy it.

### Design

The original website was put together without knowledge of web design and development. I will use it as a starting point and improve the things based on best practices and what I have learnt so far.

### Developmemt

Development is in progress.
