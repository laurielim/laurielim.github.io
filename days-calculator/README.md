# Days Calculator

This is a days calculator and an event countdown application.

Given two dates, the app will show the user how many calender days and how many business days there are between those two date. If no start date is given, the default start date is today.

The app will also start counting down from the current start date and time until a specified event which would happen at the end date.

It is the result of the following assignment and instructions.

## First step

- User inputs date (end-date)
- User inputs events name
- Program counts how many days there is left until the entered date (from today (start date) until end date) and prints it with the event name on the screen

## Second step

- The program counts how many business days there is left until the entered date (from today (start date) until the end date and skipping Saturdays and Sundays)
- Prints the amount of the days also to the screen

## Third step

- User can select start time
- The program counts how many days there is left until the entered date (from today (start date) until end date)
- Print counted days and counted business days until the event

## Fourth step

- Make your app beautiful! (backgrounds, fonts, nice inputs and button)
- Add real-time counter (days, hours, minutes, seconds) to the event
- Print count down to the screen
- Upload your solution to a server (github page, school server, etc) and post the link to the solution in Itslearning

## Bonus step

- Do all steps and add an opportunity to count only business days (also skipping bank holidays)
